#### By _**Brett Cordell**

## Description
This application will be able to take in the users age, and demographic as mentioned and provide an updated age for the following planets:
Mercury, Venus, Mars and Jupiter. Each of the ages will be based on the solar year of each planet. The expected outcomes and math associated with be better described in the expected outcomes, and specs portion of this read me._

_Specs:
*  User will enter their current age.
*  User age will be plugged in to formula for each planet (Mercury, Venus, Mars and Jupiter) and have their age returned.
*  User will also have a projected life expectancy.
*  If living past provided expectancy, years lived past expectancy will also be revealed.

Solar Years Formula by planet:
* A Mercury year is .24 Earth years.
* A Venus year is .62 Earth years.
* A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years.
* A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.

Expected Outcomes:


## Setup/Installation Requirements

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Java script.
* jQuery (v4.2.1).

This project was tasked to better continue exploration of prior CSS and HTML knowledge while further implementing JS and jQuery to the page to better enhance site functionality.

This project was a challenge to better practice, and implement the use of Constructors, and prototypes to better calculate costs, and manipulate keys within an Object.
